You can change the default values of other parameters to simulate different conditions. Refer to the options section.

## Options
The default values for various paramters parsed to the experiment are given in ```options.py```. Details are given some of those parameters:

* ```--dataset:```  Default: 'mnist'. Options: 'mnist', 'fmnist', 'cifar'
* ```--model:```    Default: 'mlp'. Options: 'mlp', 'cnn'
* ```--gpu:```      Default: None (runs on CPU). Can also be set to the specific gpu id.
* ```--epochs:```   Number of rounds of training.
* ```--lr:```       Learning rate set to 0.01 by default.
* ```--verbose:```  Detailed log outputs. Activated by default, set to 0 to deactivate.
* ```--seed:```     Random Seed. Default set to 1.

#### Federated Parameters
* ```--iid:```      Distribution of data amongst users. Default set to IID. Set to 0 for non-IID.
* ```--num_users:```Number of users. Default is 100.
* ```--frac:```     Fraction of users to be used for federated updates. Default is 0.1.
* ```--local_ep:``` Number of local training epochs in each user. Default is 10.
* ```--local_bs:``` Batch size of local updates in each user. Default is 10.
* ```--unequal:```  Used in non-iid setting. Option to split the data amongst users equally or unequally. Default set to 0 for equal splits. Set to 1 for unequal splits.
