# BERT for calculating sentance similarity
This code is a copy from the reference code link for Exercise 4.13.
In order to utilize the pre-trained BERT model, here are a few steps you need to follow:
1. Download the pre-trained BERT model from [https://github.com/google-research/bert?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/google-research/bert?tab=readme-ov-file) and the files named 'config.json' and 'pytorch_model.bin' from [https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased/tree/main).
2. Put the all unziped files into the BERT folder.
3. Install the 'transformers' package through pip.
4. Run the 'bert.py' file.
